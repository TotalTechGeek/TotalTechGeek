### Hey there üëã

I'm Jesse! I'm a Software Architect & a total tech geek! I specialize in cloud architecture & back-end systems, but I love working on dev tools to make life better for other devs.

My GitHub is not necessarily a showcase of my cleanest code (I work on some of these side projects in my spare time), but it is a a portfolio of some of my passion projects.

Some of my ‚ù§Ô∏è projects are:
- [Pineapple](https://github.com/TotalTechGeek/pineapple), an inline software testing framework to make testing sweet!
- [JSON Logic Engine](https://github.com/TotalTechGeek/json-logic-engine), a fast, sandboxed logic engine to set up powerful configurations.
- [Pictoprime](https://github.com/TotalTechGeek/pictoprime), my picture to prime generator featured in a Matt Parker video! 


If you're looking for some of my cleaner projects:
- [Doczen](https://github.com/TotalTechGeek/doczen) is designed with plugins to sync your documentation from your repo to other services,
- [deejay-file-query](https://github.com/TotalTechGeek/deejay-file-query) is a tool similar to jq that allows you to use Deejay (a scripting language I developed) to remix your data.
- [simple-password-rules](https://github.com/TotalTechGeek/simple-password-rules) is a simple declarative library for defining password rules. It pairs well with JSON Logic Engine.
- [plural-squirrel](https://github.com/TotalTechGeek/plural-squirrel) is a boring pluralization library üòâ


There are a handful of other libraries and utilities on my GitHub like [nspdh](https://github.com/TotalTechGeek/nspdh), [DiscreteCrypt](https://github.com/TotalTechGeek/discretecrypt), and [json-power-query](https://github.com/TotalTechGeek/json-power-query), but they may not be as actively maintained / showcase as well.
